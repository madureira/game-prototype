# game-prototype
A simple 2D top-down game framework, built on top of SDL2 and C++.

You can build games, like: [Chrono Trigger](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrono_Trigger)

To facilitate game development, the framework integrates with the following tools:
* [Tiled Map Editor](http://www.mapeditor.org/) (Used to build maps based on tiles)
* [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) (Used to generates sprites and animations)

## Dependencies
This structure is built using the following tools:

* [C++](http://www.cplusplus.com/)
* [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/)
* [SDL_image 2.0](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/)
* [SDL_mixer 2.0](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/)
* [SDL_ttf 2.0](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/)
* [TinyXML-2](https://github.com/leethomason/tinyxml2)
* [nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json)

## Importing the project
If you use **Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2017** to develop, follow the steps bellow.

1. Open Visual Studio
1. On menu bar, select: **File > New > Project...**
1. On left-side, select **Templates** and **Visual C++**
1. On right-side, select: **Empty Project**
1. On the field **Name:** write: `game-prototype`
1. On the field **Location:** write the path where your project folder is. In this example: `C:\Users\your-user\projects\workspace`
1. On field **Solution name:** write: `game-prototype`
1. Check the box: **Create directory for solution**
1. Hit **OK**

If all went well, you will see your project in the column: **Solution Explorer**

Now to be more easy to understand the project structure, change de view mode:
1. On **Solution Explorer** click on **Show All Files** icon.
1. Now, expand some folders inside *assets* and *src*, to see some files...
1. Observes if the files has a red icon, indicating that it is not included on the project. If it is, right-click on the file and select **Include In Project**. Try to include the whole folder to make all files inside it part of the project (sometimes this don't works).

Done, the project is imported and the source files is included, now we need to configure it.

## Configuring
To be able to build and run our project, we need to configure it. So, let's start!

### *Configuring the output folder*
1. Right click on **game-prototype** in **Solution Explorer**
1. Properties
1. You gonna see on the top of the window, the selector: **Configuration**, so, select the option: `All Configurations`
1. On selector **Plataform**, select the option `Win32`
1. On left-side of the window, click on **General**
1. Now, in right-side, edit the field **Output Directory**. Change the default value to: `$(SolutionDir)bin\$(Configuration)\`
1. In **Intermediate Directory** put the value: `$(SolutionDir)bin\$(Configuration)\intermediates\`
1. Hit the button **Apply**

### *Configuring the include paths*
1. On left-side, select **VC++ Directories**
1. Now, in right-side, edit the field **Include Directories**. A modal is gonna open. Now add this folders, on-by-one:
```
$(SolutionDir)dependencies\SDL2-2.0.5\include
$(SolutionDir)dependencies\SDL2_image-2.0.1\include
$(Solutiondir)dependencies\SDL2_mixer-2.0.1\include
$(SolutionDir)dependencies\SDL2_ttf-2.0.14\include
$(SolutionDir)dependencies\glm
```
1. Hit the button **OK** to close modal and hit the button **Apply**


### *Configuring Linker*
1. On left-side, expand **Linker** and select **General**
1. Edit the field: **Additional Library Directories**. A modal is gonna open, so, include the follow paths, one-by-one:
```
$(SolutionDir)dependencies\SDL2-2.0.5\lib\x86
$(SolutionDir)dependencies\SDL2_image-2.0.1\lib\x86
$(SolutionDir)dependencies\SDL2_mixer-2.0.1\lib\x86
$(SolutionDir)dependencies\SDL2_ttf-2.0.14\lib\x86
```
1. Hit the button **OK** to close modal and hit the button **Apply**
1. On left-side, expand **Linker** and now select **Input**
1. Edit the field: **Additional Dependencies**. A modal is gonna open, so, include the follow libraries:
```
SDL2.lib
SDL2main.lib
SDL2_image.lib
SDL2_mixer.lib
SDL2_ttf.lib
```
1. Hit the button **OK** to close modal and hit the button **Apply**
1. On left-side, expand **Linker** and now select **System**
1. Edit the field: **SubSystem** and select the option: `Console (/SUBSYSTEM:CONSOLE)`
1. Hit the button **Apply**
1. Now you can hit **OK** to close the configuration properties window.

## Adding DLL's
Now, we need to add the project's DLL's before run the build.

You can find all needed DLL's inside the path: `game-prototype/dependencies/DLLs/`.

Copy everything and paste inside: `game-prototype/bin/Debug/` and `game-prototype/bin/Release/`

## Building
After all this boring configuration, we able to finally build and run the project.

1. On the top of Visual Studio, you can see a selector where you have the options: `Debug`, `Release` and `Configuration Manager...`. Select the option `Debug`.
1. Select the option `x86` on the next selector.
1. Click on play button `Local Windows Debugger` to run the application on Debug mode.
